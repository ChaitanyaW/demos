Bootstrap (2.3.2) with .net 4.0: demo of master pages
=====

BootstrapASP: a fork of the demo built of the tutorial at [geekswithblogs.net](http://geekswithblogs.net/JeremyMorgan/archive/2012/09/18/how-to-use-twitter-bootstrap-on-an-asp.net-website.aspx) using asp.net 4.0 (C# web forms), though instead of ResolveURL, it uses Script Manager, as per this [stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12452109/asp-net-2012-unobtrusive-validation-with-jquery) thread. It also uses a marketing sample from the Twitter Bootstrap Github Examples. Also, has examples of using google maps in modals, as well as how to stylize login controls.

Upcoming Additions:

- Menu via asp.net control
- Dynamic tabs and post from form
