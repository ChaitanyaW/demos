Bootstrap (2.3.2) with .net 4.0: demo of master pages
=====

BootstrapASP: a fork of the demo built of the tutorial at [geekswithblogs.net](http://geekswithblogs.net/JeremyMorgan/archive/2012/09/18/how-to-use-twitter-bootstrap-on-an-asp.net-website.aspx) using asp.net 4.0 (C# web forms), though instead of ResolveURL, it uses Script Manager, as per this [stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12452109/asp-net-2012-unobtrusive-validation-with-jquery) thread. It also uses a marketing sample from the Twitter Bootstrap Github Examples. Also, has examples of using google maps in modals, as well as how to stylize login controls.

Upcoming Additions:
- Dynamic tabs and post from form
- Add font-awesome (commented out)  if needed in projects.

Last update:

- November 7, 2013: Updated menu to be asp.net menu. Based off [techbrij.com's blog post](http://techbrij.com/responsive-menu-twitter-bootstrap-asp-net).
- November 6, 2013: Updated meta tags, and added botstrap cdn to gloabl.asax.
