demos
=====

A place that code samples are stored.

BootstrapASP: a fork of the demo built of the tutorial at [geekswithblogs.net](http://geekswithblogs.net/JeremyMorgan/archive/2012/09/18/how-to-use-twitter-bootstrap-on-an-asp.net-website.aspx) using asp.net 4.0 (C# web forms), though instead of ResolveURL, it uses Script Manager, as per this [stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12452109/asp-net-2012-unobtrusive-validation-with-jquery) thread. It also uses a marketing sample from the Twitter Bootstrap Github Examples. Also, has examples of using google maps in modals, as well as how to stylize login controls.

BootstrapPHP-imdbSearch: a demo built of that uses the IMDB API from [mymovieapi.com](http://mymovieapi.com/). This code is using PHP5 and Simple XMl as the backend. The front end is created using bootstrap. Here is a [demo](http://jenntesolin.com/Bootstrap-IMDB/index.php). 

Bootstrapjs-imdbSearch: similar to above but using only javascript. Currently troubleshooting why the results do not want to empty beforre reloading the next set (duplicates appearing).

phpAuction: php5 with mysqli site, and yes, bootstrap front end again. To use, you will first need to importt the sql queries in the resources folder. Once this is completed, please remove this directory from the project folder. This is an early version, and upcoming one with include emails, as well as stronger password security.No demo yet, as I am in the process of moving hosts.
