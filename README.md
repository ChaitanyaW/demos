BootstrapASP: a demo built of the tutorial at [geekswithblogs.net](http://geekswithblogs.net/JeremyMorgan/archive/2012/09/18/how-to-use-twitter-bootstrap-on-an-asp.net-website.aspx) using asp.net 4.0 (C# web forms), though instead of ResolveURL, it uses Script Manager, as per this [stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12452109/asp-net-2012-unobtrusive-validation-with-jquery) thread. It also uses a marketing sample from the Twitter Bootstrap Github Examples.

BootstrapPHP-imdbSearch: a demo built of that uses the IMDB API from [mymovieapi.com](http://mymovieapi.com/). This code is using PHP5 and Simple XMl as the backend. The front end is created using bootstrap. Here is a [demo](http://jenntesolin.com/Bootstrap-IMDB/index.php). The folder strcuture on your srver should be: 
Web Root
	- index.php
	- imdb.php
	/css
	/fonts
In other words, move files out of the app folder.
